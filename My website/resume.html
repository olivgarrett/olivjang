  <h2>Hello! My name is Olivia Garrett. Welcome to my website.</h2>
  <p>I’m a junior at the University of Missouri working on a dual-degree in journalism and political science with a minor in Spanish.</p>
  <p>On the journalism side, I’m studying print and digital news with an emphasis on investigative journalism.</p>
  <p>I’m currently reporting on local news at the Columbia Missourian and fact-checking for PolitiFact Missouri.</p>
  <p>Previously, I was an intern at POLITICO Europe in Brussels, Belgium. Before that, I was on the community outreach team at the Missourian. I was also a beat reporter and editor on the university news section at the Maneater, MU’s student newspaper.</p>
  <p>I’m from Texas, and like most Texans I know, I’m a fan of BBQ, Tex-Mex and kolaches. When I’m not writing, I like to bake and explore new places.</p>
  <p>Skills I’ve picked up along the way: Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Audition. Photography and basic video and audio production. AP Style. Excel and SQLite. Social media posting- Buffer, Social Media Desk, Twitter and Facebook. Reporting skills such as interviewing, fact-checking and writing. WordPress, Blox.</p>
  <p>Skills I’m currently working on learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fact-checking.</p>
