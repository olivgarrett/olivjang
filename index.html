          <p>I'm a reporter with an interest in local journalism. My work has included regular coverage of schools and cities, service journalism and longform pieces about funerals, dinosaurs, saints and knitters. I'm currently a general assignment reporter for the Dubuque Telegraph Herald in Dubuque, Iowa. I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2019. As a student, I spent time in the Columbia Missourian, Politifact Missouri, POLITICO Europe and Maneater newsrooms.</p>
          <p>Originally from Texas, school and work took me to Missouri and then Iowa. I've picked up plenty of reporting skills, but I'm still learning how to handle the cold weather. In my free time, I frequent book stores, parks and hiking trails where I can bring my cat, the farmers market and knitting circles.</p>

          <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Nov. 15, 2021</p>
        <p>The idea for this artilce came when a contact at a local funeral home inquired about adding a holiday grief-counseling event to a community event calendar. I realized that an article on this subject might provide readers with resources and ideas dealing with a struggle they might otherwise face entirely on their own, unsure where to turn to for help.</p></section>

        <p>I tackle two reader-submitted questions. One question centered on the status of a unique community initiative that was lost to the pandemic. Another focused on an odd siting at the park. Since joining the TH, I've handled tracking down answers to a wide variety of community queries in the "Ask the TH" series.</p></section>

          <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Jan. 7, 2022</p>
        <p>When two small-town firefighters were killed in a deadly crash, I was sent to write the first story for the Telegraph Herald. At the time I was writing, the names of the deceased had not yet been released, but already the news was sending shockwaves around the region. I was tasked with documenting how the community was reacting in the immediate aftermath of the loss, though information and hard facts were still unknown.</p></section>

          <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Jan. 1, 2022</p>
        <p>As the only reporter working on the Friday before New Years Day, I was holding down the fort and covering any story that came in. This was a fairly simple story about local concerns regarding a railroad merger. I've decided to highlight it because I was proud of the number of people I was able to reach on relatively short notice on a holiday when sources were tricky to round up.</p></section>

  <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Oct. 24, 2021</p>
  <p>Generally speaking, front page stories at the TH are 20-25 inches and inside stories are 15 inches. But, each Sunday, a reporter is given the chance to write a 60-80 inch centerpiece about any topic they'd like. This story idea came to me in a dream. Over the course of several weeks, I interviewed people about death, grief, funerals and what it's like to work in the funeral and other funeral-adjacent industries.</p></section>

  <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Aug. 29, 2021</p>
  <p>An editor asked me to write a feature for the business page and, seeing the opportunity to hop on a river boat, I jumped on it. This is the type of story I enjoy doing -- something where I get ask all my burning questions about something fun that I know nothing about.</p></section>

    <p class="byline">Fulton Sun, Aug. 22, 2020</p>
    <p>When I first started writing for a small town newspaper in Missouri, I didn't expect to find myself on the triceratops beat. This story details how a team from a local college discovered a massive fossil. This story received second place in the Best Feature Story category in the Missouri Press Association's 2021 Better Newspaper Contest (Class 1 Dailies).</p></section>
