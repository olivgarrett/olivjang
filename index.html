    <p>I’m a student at the University of Missouri working on a dual-degree in investigative journalism and political science with a minor in Spanish.</p>
    <p>I'm graduating in December 2019. After graduation, I hope to work for a print or digital news organization. Writing is my main passion, but I also enjoy photography and design. I built this portfolio website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I’m currently working as an assistant city editor at the Columbia Missourian, a community newspaper in Columbia, Missouri. In this role, I help coach beginning reporters and edit their stories.</p>
    <p>Previously, I reported for the community and education beats at the Missourian. I've covered everything from the local school board to Missouri tourism. During the spring, I wrote fact-checks for PolitiFact Missouri. This past fall, I was an intern at POLITICO Europe in Brussels, Belgium. There, I primarily worked on the production desk, crafting social media posts and designing pages for the print edition. I was also a beat reporter and editor on the university news section at the Maneater, MU’s student newspaper.</p>
