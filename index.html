          <p>I'm a reporter with an interest in local journalism. I currently live in Fulton, Missouri, where I cover everything and anything for the Fulton Sun. My beat includes the universities, schools and rural communities of Callaway County, including Fulton, Holts Summit, New Bloomfield and Mokane. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I've written about school closures and reopenings, the efforts of local governments and the reactions of businesses, faith communities and families.</p>
          <p>Two of my projects were recognized by the Missouri Press Association during the 2020 Better Newspaper Contest. A story I wrote about a Missouri native's life and path to sainthood recieved an honorable mention for Best Story About Religion. A full-page graphic I designed based on information from my reporting on the rehabilitation of a major Missouri River crossing was awarded second place in the Best Infographic category.</p>
          <p>In December 2019, I graduated from the University of Missouri with a dual-degree in investigative journalism and political science and a minor in Spanish.</p>
          <p>While in school, I spent much of my time in the Columbia Missourian newsroom, with stints as an assistant city editor, reporter, graphic designer and member of the community outreach team. Along the way, I also worked with PolitiFact Missouri, POLITICO Europe in Brussels, Belgium and my campus newspaper, The Maneater.</p>
          <p>I built this portfolio website using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.</p>

        <p>When I first started writing for a small town newspaper in Missouri, I didn't expect to find myself on the triceratops beat. This story details how a team from a local college discovered a massive fossil.</p></section>
