          <p>I'm a reporter with an interest in local journalism. I currently live in Fulton, Missouri, where I cover everything and anything for the Fulton Sun. My beat includes the universities, schools and rural communities of Callaway County, including Holts Summit, New Bloomfield and Mokane. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I've written about school closures and reopenings, the efforts of local governments and the reactions of businesses, faith communities and families.</p>
          <p>  In December 2019, I graduated from the University of Missouri with a dual-degree in investigative journalism and political science and a minor in Spanish.</p>
          <p>While in school, I spent much of my time in the Columbia Missourian newsroom, with stints as an assistant city editor, reporter, graphic designer and member of the community outreach team. Along the way, I also worked with PolitiFact Missouri, POLITICO Europe and my campus newspaper, The Maneater.</p>
          <p>I built this portfolio website using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.</p>

          <p>Here are some of the projects I'm proudest of:
            <div class="proudt">
          <p><a href="https://www.fultonsun.com/news/local/story/2020/aug/22/fossil-find-stuns-westminster-team/838482/" class="proud" target="_blank">Fossil find stuns Westminster team</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.fultonsun.com/news/local/story/2020/aug/01/mokane-teen-works-clean-cemetery/836245/" class="proud" target="_blank">Mokane teen works to clean up cemetery</a></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/tolton-catholic-s-namesake-progresses-on-a-path-to-sainthood/article_2ca67e40-49c1-11e9-8eef-d7714c6c5aa0.html" target="_blank" class="proud">Tolton Catholic's namesake progresses on a path to sainthood</a> While driving across the state and searching through historical records, I had to figure out how to put to words the complicated relationship between race and religion.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/documentary-recalls--year-old-fight-for-wetlands-wastewater-treatment/article_be460432-1aac-11e8-83bc-eb2d4e8fee2c.html" target="_blank" class="proud"> Documentary recalls 30-year-old fight for wetlands wastewater treatment at Eagle Bluffs</a> Reporting this story was a breath of fresh air, complete with punny names, protest folk songs and waterfowl. I was able to highlight how an innovative and environmentally-conscious wastewater treatment system came to be.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/unbound-book-fest-ripped-for-lack-of-inclusion-silencing-panelist/article_677e2686-417e-11e8-b8f3-07368a2077a5.html" target="_blank" class="proud">Unbound Book fest ripped for lack of inclusion, silencing panelist last year</a> I had to grapple with ethical questions and sources who at first wanted to stay off the record for this breaking news story about allegations of racism at a festival that is a source of pride in the community.</p>
