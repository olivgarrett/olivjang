          <p>I'm a reporter with an interest in local journalism. My work has included regular coverage of schools and cities, service journalism and longform pieces about funerals, dinosaurs, saints and knitters. I'm currently a general assignment reporter for the Dubuque Telegraph Herald in Dubuque, Iowa. I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2019. As a student, I spent time in the Columbia Missourian, Politifact Missouri, POLITICO Europe and Maneater newsrooms.</p>
          <p>Originally from Texas, school and work took me to Missouri and then Iowa. I've picked up plenty of reporting skills, but I'm still learning how to handle the cold weather. In my free time, I frequent book stores, parks and hiking trails where I can bring my cat, the farmers market and knitting circles.</p>

          <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Jan. 7, 2022</p>
        <p>When two small-town firefighters were killed in a deadly crash, I was sent to write the first story for the Telegraph Herald. At the time I was writing, the names of the deceased had not yet been released, but already the news was sending shockwaves around the region. I was tasked with documenting how the community was reacting in the immediate aftermath of the loss, though information and hard facts were still unknown.</p></section>

                <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Feb. 4, 2022</p>
              <p>Some of my favorite things to write about are kids and learning. This is an example of a lighter story, highlighting a fun elementary school field trip tradition local families are familiar with.</p></section>

                      <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Jan. 14, 2022</p>
                    <p>This is an example of a quick hit, daily story. There is a real shortage of child care options in the Dubuque community, so this story fits in with a slew of other stories and ongoing coverage about efforts to increase child care options.</p></section>

  <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Oct. 24, 2021</p>
  <p>Generally speaking, front page stories at the TH are 20-25 inches and inside stories are 15 inches. But, each Sunday, a reporter is given the chance to write a 60-80 inch centerpiece about any topic they'd like. This story idea came to me in a dream. Over the course of several weeks, I interviewed people about death, grief, funerals and what it's like to work in the funeral and other funeral-adjacent industries.</p></section>

  <p class="byline">Dubuque Telegraph Herald, Aug. 29, 2021</p>
  <p>An editor asked me to write a feature for the business page and, seeing the opportunity to hop on a river boat, I jumped on it.</p></section>

  <p class="byline">Fulton Sun, March 20, 2020</p>
  <p>This was actually one of the first COVID-19 stories I wrote. My community confirmed its first positive case in the hours after this story went live. The focus of this article was on the impact of the pandemic on a local college.</p></section>

    <section class="wordsl3"><a href="https://www.fultonsun.com/news/local/story/2020/aug/22/fossil-find-stuns-westminster-team/838482/" target="_blank"><h3>Fossil find stuns Westminster team</h3></a>
    <p class="byline">Fulton Sun, Aug. 22, 2020</p>
    <p>When I first started writing for a small town newspaper in Missouri, I didn't expect to find myself on the triceratops beat. This story details how a team from a local college discovered a massive fossil. This story received second place in the Best Feature Story category in the Missouri Press Association's 2021 Better Newspaper Contest (Class 1 Dailies).</p></section>
