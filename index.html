    <p>I’m a student at the University of Missouri working on a dual-degree in investigative journalism and political science with a minor in Spanish.</p>
    <p>I’m currently reporting on community news at the Columbia Missourian and fact-checking for PolitiFact Missouri.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was an intern at POLITICO Europe in Brussels, Belgium. There, I primarily worked on the production desk, crafting social media posts and designing pages for the print edition. Before that, I was an education beat reporter and a member of the community outreach team at the Missourian. I was also a beat reporter and editor on the university news section at the Maneater, MU’s student newspaper.</p>
    <p>Writing is my main passion, but I also enjoy photography and design. I coded this portfolio website.</p>

    <p>I’m from Texas and I’m a fan of BBQ, Tex-Mex and kolaches. When I’m not writing, I like to bake and explore new places.</p>
    <p>I'm planning on graduating in December 2019. After graduation, I hope to work as a reporter for a print or digital news organization.</p>
