          <p>I'm a reporter with an interest in writing, data visualization and engagement. In December 2019, I'll be graduating from the University of Missouri with a dual-degree in investigative journalism and political science and a minor in Spanish.</p>
          <p>I'm currently a designer on the graphics desk of the Columbia Missourian. I've spent most of my time over the past few years in the Missourian newsroom, with stints as a reporter, member of the community outreach team and assistant city editor. Along the way, I've also worked with PolitiFact Missouri, POLITICO Europe and my campus newspaper, the Maneater.</p>
          <p>I built this portfolio website using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.</p>

          <p>These are a few of the projects I'm most proud of:
            <div class="proudt">
          <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/tolton-catholic-s-namesake-progresses-on-a-path-to-sainthood/article_2ca67e40-49c1-11e9-8eef-d7714c6c5aa0.html" target="_blank" class="proud">Tolton Catholic's namesake progresses on a path to sainthood</a> While driving across the state and searching through historical records, I had to figure out how to put to words the complicated relationship between race and religion.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/documentary-recalls--year-old-fight-for-wetlands-wastewater-treatment/article_be460432-1aac-11e8-83bc-eb2d4e8fee2c.html" target="_blank" class="proud"> Documentary recalls 30-year-old fight for wetlands wastewater treatment at Eagle Bluffs</a> Reporting this story was a breath of fresh air, complete with punny names, protest folk songs and waterfowl. I was able to highlight how an innovative and environmentally-conscious wastewater treatment system came to be.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/unbound-book-fest-ripped-for-lack-of-inclusion-silencing-panelist/article_677e2686-417e-11e8-b8f3-07368a2077a5.html" target="_blank" class="proud">Unbound Book fest ripped for lack of inclusion, silencing panelist last year</a> I had to grapple with ethical questions and sources who at first wanted to stay off the record for this breaking news story about allegations of racism at a festival that is a source of pride in the community.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/new-historical-society-building-will-connect-missourians-to-a-rich/article_f076e3dc-6c3a-11e9-9836-4b1ea8156017.html" target="_blank" class="proud">New Historical Society building will connect Missourians to a rich past</a> I toured my first construction site and took advantage of the chance to slow down and choose my words carefully.</p>
